# Zotero Plugins 6.0.36 or 7

This is a curated list of awesome Zotero plugins available for the latest old Zotero version **6.0.36** or the latest new **Zotero 7**. 

Keeping track of whether the plugin is still under maintenance by its author and the latest releases compatible with both versions is essential. Some plugins can be a big part of your day-to-day use, so consider the downsides of upgrading or whether you'd want to downgrade.

You can't have both versions at the same time, but if you want to, you can install Zotero 7 and get a portable Zotero 6, or vice versa. They will share the plugins, allowing you to see all plugins available, but they will respectively work in each version that they are compatible with. This way, you can use Zotero 6-only plugins.
